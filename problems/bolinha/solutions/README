--------------------
Directory structure
--------------------

Put in the directory "good" solutions that should be used to
calculate the time limits for the problem.

Put in the directory "pass" solutions that should execute within
the time limit calculated for the problem but are not particularly
efficient (algorithm or implementation), and therefore should not be
considered to calculate the time limits for the problem.

Put in the directory "wrong" solutions that must fail (that is, at
least one test should make the solution fail).

Put in the directory "slow" solutions that must timeout (that is, at
least one test should make the solution timeout).

--------------------
Naming the solutions
--------------------

Name your solution with your name, for example

myname.cpp or myname.java

You don't need to include the name of the problem in the name of the
solution.

If appropriate, include in the name information about the complexity
of the solution:

myname-n3.c, myname-bfs.py

Do not use the same name for different languages, as box will get
confused. If necessary, include also the language in the name of the
solution:

myname-n3.cpp, myname-n3-java.java, myname-n3-py3.py

For solutions in python, the first line must be 

#!/usr/bin/env python3

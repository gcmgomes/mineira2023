To make Boca packages:

1) build input, output for all problems in the tree (for example, box check)
2) build pdfs for contest and warmup

Then, go to either "contest" or "warmup" in this directory

1) in the pdf directory, edit split.sh to generate individual pdfs for each problem
2) execute ./gen_problem_descr.py to generate the auxiliary file problems.desc
3) execute ../bin/build_package.py

Built packages will be in the packages directory.

To verify the test data generated, execute ./diff.sh. But diff.sh
expects that for each problem there is a solution whose name includes
the word "reference" (for example hotdog-reference.cpp)
